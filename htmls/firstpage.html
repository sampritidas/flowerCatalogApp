        <strong>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
          Abelialeaf)</strong> is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
        the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
        <strong>Abeliophyllum distichum</strong> Nakai, endemic to Korea,
        where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only
        seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
        white, not yellow, flowers.
        It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves
        are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,
        pubescent both above and below. The flowers are pro-
        duced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they
        are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed
        corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3 cm di-
        ameter.
        It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North
        America.
